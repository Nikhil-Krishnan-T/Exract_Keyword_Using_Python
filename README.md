# Extract Keywords Using Python

Keywords play an important role when reading a long text to understand the subject and context of the text. Search engines also analyze an projectâ€™s keywords before indexing it. 

That's what keyword extraction in Python is all about. Unstructured and cluttered data contains lots of useless information and it's important to refine and filter out important information from it. 

The process of extracting keywords helps us identifying the importance of words in a text. This task can be also used for topic modelling.

Rake is short for Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction and it is a method of extracting keywords from individual documents. It can also be applied to new fields very easily and is very effective in dealing with multiple types of documents, especially text that requires specific grammatical conventions. Rake identifies key phrases in a text by analyzing the occurrence of a word and its compatibility with other words in the text (co-occurrence).
